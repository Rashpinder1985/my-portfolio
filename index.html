    <h2>🎓 Education & Research</h2>
    <p>In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering Education, with a dissertation titled:
      <em>“A Qualitative Study of Conceptual Knowledge and Characterisation of Expertism in Engineering Students.”</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a two-tier concept inventory for assessing conceptual understanding.</li>
      <li>Explored traits like automaticity and self-efficacy in high-performing engineering students.</li>
      <li>Provided strategies to enhance conceptual learning outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
