      <h2>üéì Education & Research</h2>
      <p>Currently pursuing Minor in AI certification course from IIT Ropar and will be appearing in the Final exam of the second and last semester on July 6, 2025. In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering Education, with a dissertation titled:
        <em>‚ÄúA Qualitative Study of Conceptual Knowledge and Characterisation of Expertism in Engineering Students.‚Äù</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a two-tier concept inventory for assessing conceptual understanding.</li>
        <li>Explored traits like automaticity and self-efficacy in high-performing engineering students.</li>
        <li>Provided strategies to enhance conceptual learning outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
